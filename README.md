# Basic Spring Dependency Injection (DI)
 1. Constructor Injection
 2. Setter Injection
 3. Annotations
 
Dependency Injection is a fundamental aspect of the Spring framework, through which the Spring container "injects" objects into other objects or "dependencies".

Simply put, this allows for loose coupling of components and moves the responsibility of managing components onto the container.

# Download spring jar files

4. Paste those jar files under lib folder.
5. Add classpath to your eclipse project.
6. Right click on your "Project" >> "Properties" >> "Java Build Path" >> "Libraries" tab >> Click "Add JARs" >> "Select all the JAR files from you lib folder" >> "Apply and Close".
